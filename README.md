# Typescript Tutorial

  ## Q1 Typescript?
   Typescript is an open-source, object-oriented programming language that is developed and maintained by Microsoft and serves as a superset of Javascript.
   Typescript code does not directly run on the browser. The browser does not understand newer versions of Javascript code. [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/typescript/home)


  ## Q2 Typescript Installation?
   To install Typescript, we can use the Node Package Manager (npm), which is the package manager for JavaScript and TypeScript.

  ## Q3 Version?
   Typescript was regularly receiving updates, and new versions were being released. [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/typescript/version)

  ## Q4 JS vs TS?
   Javascript and Typescript are both programming languages, but Typescript is a superset of Javascript, meaning that it extends features from Javascript and adds additional features 
   of its own into the language.[read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/typescript/js-vs-ts)
   
  ## Q5 Typescript Features?
   Typescript is a superset of Javascript, which means that it includes all the features of Javascript and extends it with additional functionalities of its own.

  ## Q6 Difference B/w Let vs Const vs Var?
   let, const, and var are used to declare variables, but they have some key differences in terms of hoisting, scope, and mutability.[read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/typescript/let-vs-const-vs-var) 

  ## Q7 Types?
   In Typescript, Types play a crucial role in defining the shape and behaviour of variables, functions, and other entities in your code. TypeScript introduces static type checking, which can help catch errors early during development and improve code quality.  [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/typescript/types)
  
  ## Q8 Operators?
   Operators are symbols or signs that allow us to perform some operations on operands, such as addition, subtraction, or multiplication. Typescript inherits most of its operators from Javascript, as they operate on values of various types.  [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/typescript/operators)
  

  ## Q9 Tuples In TypeScript?
   In TypeScript, a tuple is a finite ordered list of elements with a specific type. Tuples allow us to express an array where the type of a fixed number of elements is known, but need not be the same. [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/typescript/tuples)

  ## Q10 Enum In TypeScript?
   In Typescript, an enum (enumeration) is a way to create a named set of named constant values. Enums allow us to define a set of related named constants, making our code more readable and self-explanatory. [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/typescript/enum)


  ## Q11 Set In TypeScript?
   In Typescript, The Set is a built-in object that represents a collection of unique values. It allows us to store and retrieve values, ensuring that each value in the set is unique. [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/typescript/set)

 
  ## Q12 Interface In TypeScript?
   In TypeScript, an Interface is a way to define a contract or a blueprint for a type. It specifies the properties and methods that a particular object must have to be considered an instance of that type.  [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/typescript/interface)

  
  ## Q13 Access Modifier In Typescript?
   In Typescript, Access Modifiers are keywords used to control the visibility of class members (properties and methods). Access Modifiers help in achieving encapsulation, which is a fundamental principle of object-oriented programming (OOP).  [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/typescript/access-modifier)

  ## Q14 Inheritance In Typescript?
   In Typescript, Inheritance allows a class (subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and methods from another class (superclass or base class).Typescript supports single inheritance, meaning a class can inherit from only one other class. [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/typescript/inheritance)

  

  ## Q15 Function vs Arrow Function In Typescript?
   In Typescript, functions are a fundamental building block for organising, and structuring code, and serve as reusable blocks of code. There are two primary ways to define functions:  [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/typescript/function-vs-arrow-function)

  
  ## Q16 Array In TypeScript?
   In TypeScript, Arrays are used to store and manipulate collections of values.
   TypeScript provides static typing, allowing us to define the type of elements that an array can contain. [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/typescript/array)

  ## Q17 Parameter In Typescript?
   In Typescript, function parameters allow us to pass values into a function when it is called. Parameters help define the inputs that a function expects, and we can specify their types to ensure type safety.  [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/typescript/parameter)

  ## Q18 Primitive vs Non-Primitive Types?
   In TypeScript, like in many programming languages, data types can be broadly categorized into two main groups.[read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/typescript/primitive-vs-non-primitive)

  ## Q19 Map In TypeScript?
   In Typescript, the Map is a built-in object that allows us to store key-value pairs, where both the "keys" and "values" can be of any data type. The Map is useful when we need to associate values with unique keys and perform operations such as "insertion", "retrieval", and "deletion" efficiently. [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/typescript/map)

  ## Q20 Classes In Typescript?
   In Typescript, Classes provide a way to create object-oriented structures, encapsulating both data(variables) and behaviour(methods/functions) into a single unit. Classes are a core feature of the language, and they offer a more organized and reusable approach to writing code.  [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/typescript/classes)

  ## Q21 Accessor (Setter/Getter) In Typescript?
   In Typescript, Accessors are a way to control the access (getters) and modification (setters) of a class property. Accessors are defined using the "get" and "set" keywords within a class.  [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/typescript/accessor)
  
  ## Q22 TypeScript Modules?
   In TypeScript, modules provide a way to organize code into reusable and encapsulated units. Modules help in structuring code, avoiding naming conflicts and promoting code organization and maintainability.  [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/typescript/modules)

  
  ## Q23 Namespaces In Typescript?
   In Typescript, namespaces are a way to organize code and avoid naming conflicts, especially when working with large codebases. It also allows us to organize our code in a much cleaner way. Namespaces provide a mechanism for encapsulating elements and avoid polluting the global scope. [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/typescript/namespaces)

  ## Q24 Modules vs Namespaces?
   In Typescript, both modules and namespaces provide mechanisms for organizing code and avoiding naming conflicts, but they have some key differences.
   It's important to note that the concept of namespaces is an older way of organizing code, and modern Typescript projects typically use modules. [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/typescript/modules-vs-namespaces)

  ## Q25 Generics In Typescript?
   Generics in Typescript allow us to create flexible and reusable components by providing a way to define types that are used as placeholders. These types can be specified when using the component, allowing for a wide range of type-safe behaviours.  [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/typescript/generics)
 
  ## Q26 Typescript Configuration?
   In TypeScript, The configuration for a TypeScript project is typically defined in a tsconfig.json file. This file allows us to specify various compiler options, including the target ECMAScript version, module system, file inclusion and exclusion patterns, and other settings.
